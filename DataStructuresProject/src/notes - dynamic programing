DP follows 2 techniques
	- memoization
		- storing the computed value in a cache/hashmap and retriving the computed value to avoid recursion
	- tabulation
		- knapsack problem
		
Knapsack problem
	- we are given some items with weight and profit
	- we also have a container/knapsack/bag whose maximum weight/capacity will be given
	- maximum profit that we can take out of this
			weights = {3,4,6,5}
			profits = {2,3,1,4}
			
			W = 8 
			n = 4 

0/1 Knapsack
	- solved using DP


Fractional Knapsack
	- solved using greedy algorithm
	- 3 approaches
		- 1st approach: select items first with max profit
		- 2nd approach: select items first with minimum weight
		- 3rd approach: select items first with maximum ratio of profit / weight
