data structures
---------------
	- the way in which the data is stored/organized
	
types
-----
	- linear data structures 
		- array, linked list
	- non-linear data structures
		- tree, heap, graph, trie
		
space complexity
time complexity
big O notation
--------------
O(1), O(n), O(n^2), O(logn), O(2^n), O(n!)



hashtable
---------
	- key value pair
	- constant time complexity when retrieving the value with the key
	- in our implemtation of hash table we will use an array to back the hashtable
	- when we insert data, we will specify the name of student as the key and the student object will be the value
	- The key can be of any data type. here we hash the key to an integer, now this integer will be one of the index of the array
	- internally, the array indices will be the key and the elements of the array will be the value
