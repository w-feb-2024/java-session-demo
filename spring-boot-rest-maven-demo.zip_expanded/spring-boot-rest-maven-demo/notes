to create the endpoints of the backend application,
----------------------------------------------------
- we need Spring REST
- this application is a monolithic application : entire backend application is a single spring boot project
- we are bringing spring  boot inside because
	- HELPS FOR FASTER DEVELOPMENT
	- spring boot already has default/opiniated configurations which we can use. 
	- we can override these configurations if we want to
	- when we create a spring boot project we can choose the build tool
	- also the bulk dependencies can be specified in pom.xml file
- going forward for backend application we will be creating a spring boot project
- how do we create a spring boot project?
	- using Eclipse STS : Spring Tool Suite
	- using spring initializer : https://start.spring.io/
		- here we create the project online and download it and import it into eclipse
				- choose maven as build tool
				- choose java as the language
				- leave the spring boot version as it is
				- specify group id and artifact id
				- add the required dependencies
				- for spring rest type web and add the dependency
				- add lombok dependency if you want to autogenerate constructors, getters/setters,
						equals/hashcode/roString
- once created, next we start creating endpoints using Spring REST
