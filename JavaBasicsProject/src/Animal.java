// if a class contains atleast one abstract method, the class in turn becomes abstarct
// abstract classes are also called incompleted classes
// we cannot create an object of an abstract class, because it is incomplete
// abstract classes are meant to be inherited, and the inherited class should provide the implementation for the abstract method 
// this subclass which extends the abstract class can be called as concrete/complete class 



// class -extends-> class
// class -implements-> interface, interface, interface
// interface -extends-> interface, interface, interface
// interface -no relation-> class
